  <h2>Objectives/Goals:</h2>
  <p>I plan to graduate from Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology with a 3.7 GPA or higher. After that I would like to work towards becoming financially stable so that I may travel and hopefully make contributions to multiple projects of my choosing. Ideally I will eventually be able to acquire a skillset that will allow me to have a career in the video game industry.</p>
